DistCp (distributed copy) is a tool used for large inter/intra-cluster copying. 
It uses Map/Reduce to effect its distribution, error handling and recovery, 
and reporting. It expands a list of files and directories into input to map tasks, 
each of which will copy a partition of the files specified in the source list.
